  title: Shrike Security
  description: |
    AI agent security scanner that protects LLM-powered applications from prompt injection,
    data exfiltration, and adversarial attacks via the Model Context Protocol.

    7 specialized security tools:
    - scan_prompt: Detect prompt injection and jailbreak attempts
    - scan_response: Scan LLM outputs for data leaks and manipulation
    - scan_sql_query: Detect SQL injection in AI-generated queries
    - scan_file_write: Validate file writes for path traversal and malicious content
    - scan_web_search: Check search queries for SSRF and domain abuse
    - report_bypass: Report novel attack patterns for community defense
    - get_threat_intel: Retrieve latest threat patterns and detection signatures

    9-layer detection pipeline: regex → unicode normalization → malformed input →
    encoding detection → token analysis → semantic analysis → visual similarity →
    LLM analysis → response intelligence.

    Shrike MCP works out of the box with regex-based scanning (no API key needed).
    Add a Shrike API key to enable LLM-powered semantic analysis layers.
